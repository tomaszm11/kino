It's intented to mimic a cinema.

Exam session is coming up which means i dont have the time to add exception errors (please type carefully ). Also there's no restrictions regarding reservations limit, I'll add those soon. Same goes for an ERD (I have one but half of it was made in paint). 
Part of the code is written in Polish because I'll use it as a project for my finals, you must forgive me. I'll translate and comment everything this weekend.
